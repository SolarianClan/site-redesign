					<h3 class="about-title mb-30">Membership &amp; Activity Requirements</h3>
								<div class="">
									<ol class="ordered-list">
										<li><span class="rule">Clan members must log in and complete an activity in Destiny 2 at least once every 30 days</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">A primary reason for these rules is to ensure the clan has a constant supply of active Guardians across all platforms for the community to engage with.  To this end, any clan member who does not complete at least one in-game activity every month in Destiny 2 will automatically be removed from the clan by the maintenance script.  Players who know in advance that they will be unable to play for an extended period of time may contact the admin team to hold their spot.  Additionally, anyone removed due to inactivity may apply to rejoin at any time.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Clan members should be at least 16 years of age</span> <span class="exception">(with a few notable exceptions)</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">While our community is "family-friendly", we aim to create a mature environment of mutual respect between members.  No perspective member under the age of 16 will be considered unless they are either related to an existing member, or have prior approval from an administrator.  To obtain prior approval, contact <a href="mailto:admin@solarian.net" hreflang="en-uk" rel="author">admin@solarian.net</a> and explain why you'd like to join.  You will be asked to play a session with an admin, as well as complete the New Member's Agreement, in order to help us assess if you'd be a good fit for the clan.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Clan members must be active in the community Discord</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">Our Discord server <span class="exception">(also known as a "Guild")</span> is the heart &amp; soul of our community.  To that end, all players must be <b>registered</b> members of the clan Discord.  To register, simply issue the command: <span class="code">?register</span> and follow the instructions provided in the direct message from Charlemagne.  Our Discord is open to all players and fans of the Destiny™ series, not just clan members — so invite your friends!</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Clan members must participate in at least one event each season</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">To help maintain a level of community engagement, all members are requested to participate in at least one clan event each season.  Qualifying events include, but are not limited to PvP Tournaments, PvE Challenges, a Drop-In Parties, and Clan Raids.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">New clan members have 15 days to transition from Beginners to full Members</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">When a new Guardian joins our clan, they start as a "Beginner".  Beginners are not able to schedule clan events or host Seekers in Guided Games.  To become a full member, Beginners must complete the New Member's Agreement, join the Discord, and play one activity (Crucible match, strike, Gambit match, Nightfall, Raid, et cetera) with an established clan member (someone who's been in the clan over 90 days &mdash; just ask).</span></li>
									<!--</ol>-->									
								<br clear="all" />
								<h3 class="about-title mb-30">Community Policies</h3>
									<!--<ol class="ordered-list">-->
										<li><span class="rule">Profane, vulgar, and explicit language is not permitted in text chat</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">While we are <i>primarily</i> a clan of adults, we do have some younger community members, as well as a few members who are not fond of profanity and vulgarity.  Hence, our Discord features a censorship bot that cleans up the majority of expletives.  However, this is not intended to be a perfectly comprehensive filter, therefore members are asked to refrain from inappropriate language in the majority of the community Discord.</span><span class="exception">(The exception to this is the #nsfw channel, specifically designed to allow members over the age of 18 to say whatever they wish &mdash; provided it doesn't violate any other rule!)</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Profane, vulgar, and explicit language is <i>discouraged</i> in voice chat</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">This rule works on the honour system and is intended to maintain decorum and civility between community members who may not know each other well.  If you're familiar with everyone in a voice chat session and know they don't mind profanity, it's certainly acceptable.  However, if you don't know someone well or are uncertain as to their views on the subject, please err on the side of caution and avoid using language you wouldn't use on a job interview.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Hate speech of any kind is not permitted in text or voice chat</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">Solarian is an open and inclusive community.  We welcome all Guardians, regardless of race, age, gender, sexual identity, politics, religion, or other personal views.  To that end, posting or reposting hateful or discriminatoy messages, images, memes, videos, or any other content in either text or voice channels will result in a warning and immediate temporary suspension from the community.  Further violations will result in a permanent ban from the community.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Discussion and postings should stay on-topic and appropriate</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">Our Discord has multiple topic channels, including memes, spoilers, lore, videos, and more.  All conversations in all these channels should be related to Destiny, the Clan, the Community, surrounding technologies, or related topics.  (The notable exception is the #other-games channel, intended for the discussion of non-Destiny video games.)  Additionally, please ensure your message is posted to the appropriate channel.  For example, all bot commands and statistics should be restricted to the #stats channel, memes in #memes, Destiny videos in #destiny-videos, et cetera.  Most importantly, please keep all story spoilers in the #spoilers channel!   Any off-topic or misplaced content may be deleted without warning.</span></li>
									<br clear="all" />
									<h3 class="about-title mb-30">Community Norms</h3>
										<li><span class="rule">Communicate with Clan Members in the Discord</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">The Destiny mobile app is quite unreliable with notifications, so please use the Discord to communicate with other community members &mdash; not the Destiny app, not platform messaging, and not Bungie.Net.  Platform messaging (PS Messages, BattleNet, etc.) tends to obstruct players' view when it pops up and is difficult to reply to without using the mobile application on console.</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Utilise the smallest possible notification group and appropriate channel</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">Our Discord has roles and channels for community members looking for others to play with.  Additionally, while we don't disable regular users ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePXoYBBaSqQ">@everyone</a>, we strongly discourage it's use.  There are notification groups to find @Raiders, @Cruciblers, @PS4 Players, and @PC Players.  Channels exist to plan game session by platform.  Finally, if your fireteam is using the Discord as a text chat platform (instead of speaking), please don't carry on in #general &mdash; use the specially-created #fireteam-text-chat channel so others can mute your team's conversation.</span></li>

										<li><span class="rule">Send Descriptive Invitations</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">If you're inviting another community member to join you in-game, please let them know up front what you're looking to do.  "Can someone help with this strike?" isn't nearly as useful as, "Looking for 2 ✧600+ Guardians to do a single 100k+ Nightfall run on The Arms Dealer with Void Burn".  And don't even bother with "Play Destiny" on the PlayStation...</span></li>
										<li><span class="rule">Don't join other players without an invitation</span><br />
											<span class="rule-description">If you're looking for other players to join, send a message on the Discord &mdash; don't just hop into someone else's fireteam or voice chat.  You may spoil a solo challenge run, join someone who is AFK, or take a spot being held for another player.  Even if it's a group of players from the community, send a message before just to ensure that they don't already have a team.</span></li>
									</ol>
								</div>
				<br clear="all">				
				<span class="rule-description">Don't be overwhelmed by these policies and procedures.  They really come down to three simple principles that guide our clan:</span>
				<ul class="unordered-list">
					<li><span class="rule">Remain active within the game</span></li>
					<li><span class="rule">Engage with the community</span></li>
					...and...
					<li><span class="rule">Be courteous to fellow players</span></li>
				</ul>
				If you follow these basic guidelines, you'll be a valuable member of our community!
