						Our first PvE Challenge for 2019 is <i>The Lonely Night</i>, a solo Nightfall challenge!  Here are the rules for this first-of-it's-kind competition in our clan:
					</p>
					<ol class="ordered-list">
						<li><span>This competition is open to all members of the Solarian community who participate in our Discord server.</span></li>
						<li><span>The winning player will post the highest score in complete solo Nightfall run any time between Tuesday, 15 January 2019 and the end of the current season.</span></li>
						<li><span>Any loadout, strike, and modifiers may be utilised &mdash; selection of these variables are part of the challenge and strategy each player may employ.</span></li>
						<li><span>Any additional players in the strike at any time will disqualify a run.</span></li>
						<li><span>To register, head to the #tournament-discussion channel on Discord, and say <b>!challenge</b>.  You will only need to do this once to participate for the rest of the season.</span></li>
						<li><span>Load into a Nightfall run by yourself, and score as many points as possible while completing the strike.</span></li>
						<li><span>At the end of the strike, take a screen capture of the score screen (the PGCR) in case the game does not save your score correctly.</span></li>
						<li><span>Immediately upon returning to orbit, head to the Discord <b>#pve-challenge</b> channel, say <b>?last nf</b>, and verify your score is correct.  (If it isn't correct, send your screenshot to soren42 directly.)</span></li>
						<li><span>Use of any exploit, glitch, bug, bot, or going out of map will disqualify your run.</span></li>
						<li><span>At the end of the season, the player with the highest reported score will receive the Grand Prize package:</span>
							<br />
								<span>In-game currency to purchase an exotic emote from the Eververse store (US$10)</span> <br>
								<span>A unique gold title in community Discord</span><br>
								<span>Some unique real-world swag related to Destiny and the Destiny community</span>
							
						</li>
						<li><span>The leadership team reserves the right to modify or amend these rules or the prizes as necessary to ensure the smooth operation of this competition.  Any disputes will be resolved solely by the leadership team, and their judgement on this will be final.</span></li>
